ABSTRACT "Ecological influences of climate change can be observed in various biological systems. Evidence suggests that several bird species have advanced their migration and breeding schedule in response to global warming. While such phenological changes have been extensively studied in species within temperate climates, there has been limited attention to tropical regions. Using climate window analyses we investigated the influence of climatic conditions on various breeding traits, e.g. date of first laying attempt within a season, in Lined Seedeaters (Sporophila lineola), an intra-tropical migratory species. We used long-term climate data associated with breeding data from nine breeding seasons from the Lined Seedeater Project, which has monitored the breeding population since 2014 in south-eastern Brazil. Overall, at the individual level, dates of the first laying attempts correlated with precipitation and temperature. Increased precipitation 90 to 22 days before the laying date predicted a delay in breeding initiation, while increased maximum temperatures 90 to 43 days before the laying date predicted an advance in breeding initiation. Interestingly, both time periods encompass the arrival period at the breeding grounds and reinforce that weather conditions before and during the arrival period can influence the onset of breeding initiation of migrant birds. Incorporating patterns of resource phenology and post-migration behaviour are paramount for understanding changes to breeding phenology of intra-tropical migrants in the face of an increasingly unpredictable climate."
